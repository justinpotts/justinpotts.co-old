Open office floor plans have long since been lauded as a way to increase serendipity in the workplace, and spark spontaneous discussion that could lead to a monumentally successful pivot or new idea. Throwing an intern into the ring forces them to become acclimated to their environment and colleagues, and the answer to a question is just a desk away.

Despite the benefits, complaints of open office plans are on the rise, with distracting noise-levels, and a fish-bowl-like feeling. Some women even reported open offices made them more uncomfortable, self-conscious, and pressured them to be conservative in the workplace, compared to some of their male counterparts. The Washington Post reported “without any privacy at their desks, they tended to sense they were being scrutinized for their appearances by male peers.”

> While open office environments may work well in more gender-balanced workplaces, where the split between men and women is more even, particularly male-heavy workplaces or those with toxic cultures could make the sense of being on display distracting. Other research has looked at the drain of what researchers call “covering,” in which people hide parts of their true selves at work in order to mesh with the dominant culture.

Despite complaints of feeling uncomfortable, unproductive, and distracted, Silicon Valley’s star CEOs have ignored the complaints of their employees in the trenches.

> The whole idea here is that, by having an open floor plan where people work close to each other, it facilitates people sharing and communicating about what they’re doing, which enables better collaboration, which we think is key to building the best services for our community.”

As it turns out, open office plans don’t facilitate sharing and communicating at all.

In a recent report published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, “the volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approx. 70%), with an associated increase in electronic interaction.” Rather than increase face-to-face conversation, open office plans increase the tendency for employees to “socially withdraw” and use tools like Slack to communicate instead.

This study is the first of its kind to analyze the effect of open office plans in an observational setting, rather than rely on surveys and self-reported behavior. The study used “sociometric badges” that recorded details about face to face interactions, like who was talking to who, who was listening versus talking, as well as body movement and posture. In addition, the study tracked IM and email activity of the employees.

To conduct the study, researchers observed two companies — both Fortune 500 companies— going through office redesigns. The first, “OpenCo1,” was in the process of transforming their office from wall-bounded workspaces, to a completely open space. The second, “OpenCo2,” was transitioning from cubicles to an open space. For OpenCo1, data was recorded for 15 days prior (3 weeks before the redesign), and for 15 days following (three months after the redesign). For OpenCo2, data was recorded for 8 weeks prior (3 months before the redesign), and for eight weeks following (two months after the redesign). Rather than the first study, the second lasted longer, and logged more data, like the teams people were a part of, or the gender of an employee.

The findings between the two were consistent, and showed that while companies undergo redesigns to encourage more face to face interaction, what they often get instead is “an open expanse of proximal employees choosing to isolate themselves as best they can (e.g. by wearing large headphones) while appearing to be as busy as possible (since everyone can see them).”

The study resulted in three key findings:

1. Open offices increase transparency in an environment where many individuals desire privacy. In an attempt to preserve this privacy, employees find other methods to communicate, like email or IM.
2. The idea of “collective intelligence” (ten people are smarter than two), relies on “intermediate levels of cues” to produce higher intelligence. Open office plans may actually be “overstimulating and thus decrease organizational productivity.”
3. With a wider range of communication platforms, employees uncomfortable with a transition to an open office plan have more options to choose from when communicating, rather than resort to face-to-face interactions.

As for productivity, substituting email for face-to-face interaction can have a negative effect.

> Because fundamentally different mechanisms drive F2F and email interaction, the physical propinquity that redesigned offices seek to achieve has a direct effect only on F2F interaction, not on email, yet drives interaction from F2F to email. Adopting open offices, therefore, appears to have the perverse outcome of reducing rather than increasing productive interaction.
> — E. Bernstein & S. Turban, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society

Additionally, the audience and intention of face-to-face interactions differs from the audience of email, which “[has] profound consequences for how — and how productively — work gets done.”

While the study doesn’t disprove open office plans as effective in some qualities, it does put a mark on the theory that open office plans will effect more face-to-face interactions.

Due to high costs in building an office with private spaces, young 20-something CEOs modeling after their heroes, and a “hipster-capitalist culture” that values openness and transparency, it’s unlikely we’ll see open offices fade away. Fortune 500 companies (like the ones in the study) are even abandoning their old floor plans in favor of the new ones.

Hello open offices, goodbye privacy.
