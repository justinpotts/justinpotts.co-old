title: Why we're bootstrapping Avenify

subtitle: A lesson in scrappiness, hustle, and capital efficiency

Almost a year ago, my co-founder, Timo, and I started working on Avenify. A few months later, we raised a little over $75,000, allowing us to leave our jobs, quit school, and go full time in January.

Now, after much consideration, Timo and I have decided to get jobs and bootstrap Avenify for the foreseeable future.

We know this is somewhat unusual, so we wanted to outline a little bit of our thinking.

## Building a startup should be about the product. Not fundraising.

When we thought about what we enjoyed most these last eight months, it wasn’t signing term sheets with investors. Sure, it’s relieving to have money in the bank. But VC funding doesn’t dictate the success of a business — revenue does.

Some of our most exciting moments were launching to students and watching them apply for funding. Processing the first batch of investments on our platform. Issuing our first ISAs. Those are the moments that matter.

When so much of a founder’s time is spent fundraising, you lose out on valuable opportunities to create those moments that matter.

## We have the freedom to choose who we work with

If worst comes to worst, startups who rely on VC funding are forced to shut down, accept bad terms, or take bad money. We want the freedom to continue working on Avenify, whether VCs are interested or not.

Bootstrapping doesn’t mean you can’t accept investments either. It means you get to be selective about who you choose to work with. And when you can cut your monthly burn to a few thousand dollars a month, a check for $5K or $10K can be incredibly meaningful.

Seek out those who are truly aligned with you and your vision, and find a way to work with them.

## Some startups don’t need money. They need time.

In a recent conversation with one investor, he said “You’re doing all the right things, but you don’t need capital. You need time.”

And he’s right. With just $75K in funding and 8 months, we:

* Worked with our legal team to draft and finalize our own ISA, disclosures, and investor agreements

* Became the only ISA company on the market to register with the SEC to solicit investments for an ISA fund

* Became the first ISA company to receive approval to work with Silicon Valley Bank

* Launched Avenify to students and investors and grew to over 2,000 students on the platform

* Issued our first ISAs to students at schools including NYU and Lambda School

That’s a lot of progress on very little cash. And with most of the long, expensive stuff out of the way, who says we can’t be even scrappier, or move even faster?

Timo and I both see incredibly potential in Avenify, and believe in our ability to build something long-lasting and meaningful. We’re committed to continuing to improve the product, release new features, issue ISAs, and become a leader in the ISA space.

We have so much planned for the next few months and can’t wait to share what we’ve been working on.
