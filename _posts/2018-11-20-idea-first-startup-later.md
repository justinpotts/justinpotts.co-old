subtitle: On finding a problem you're passionate about, and working from there

---

With all the hype around billion-dollar valuations, acquisitions left and right, and more venture capital than we know what to do with, it’s easy to get excited at the possibility of building something big. Of course! Who doesn’t want to join the three comma club? But, it’s all too easy for the idea of becoming wealthy and successful to be a distraction from what you’re actually passionate about.

I’ve built numerous projects — more than I can count, actually. Only a couple of those turned into startups. Only one of those should’ve. In the struggle to build something big and meaningful, I lost sight of what I enjoyed. And, too far into building the company, I realized I was more excited about having an idea, than the idea itself.

When you add the excitement of having a company on top of an idea, it can be harder to gauge your genuine passion for what you’re working on. The excitement of incorporating, sending emails, building decks, and attempting to raise money (often prematurely, I might add), will wear off eventually. Instead of building, you’re doing busy work. And once you run out of busy work, which happens much quicker than you think, you’re left with the idea itself.

If you start with the idea, rather than start with the company, you can iterate much faster. You’ll quickly realize whether you enjoy the field, are drawn to the research, and want to spend the rest of your life dedicated to this problem, because you have nothing to lose by putting it on the shelf, and if it’s unenjoyable, little to gain by continuing to work on it. Who wants to spend their weekends doing something they don’t enjoy?

If you look at some of the most successful companies today, they didn’t start out to build the next big thing, they started out by building what they want to see and use:

* Uber: Travis Kalanick and Garret Camp couldn’t get a taxi in Paris. Travis also liked the idea of looking “baller” in San Francisco.
* Airbnb: Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, needed some extra cash, so they took advantage of the design conference in town to host a guest on their air mattress.
* Twitter: Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone needed a project for an Odeo hackathon. Neither one said they could’ve imagined where it is today.
* Snapchat: Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy wanted a fun way to communicate with their friends. In his USC commencement speech, Evan emphasized indicators of genuine passion, saying, “If you sell [your company], you will know immediately that it wasn’t the right dream anyways. And if you don’t sell you’re probably onto something. Maybe you have the beginning of something meaningful.”

Sure, there are some exceptions to the rule, but there’s no doubt you’ll be more successful if you enjoy what you’re working on. The best way to figure that out early, before it comes time to sell your company, is to remove all the fake hype and excitement to begin with. No wonder some of Silicon Valley’s investors are putting their money into companies that started as weekend projects. In 2017, Ryan Hoover (founder of Product Hunt), started the Weekend Fund, a $3 million fund dedicated to investing in “side projects driven by curiosity and an eagerness to build something new” (read more).

So before you embark on the arduous 10-year journey, ask yourself: Are you excited about starting something, or excited about starting the thing?
